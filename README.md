## Analysis
The data was first grouped according to the year of the test series and test number. The winner and the host of each match were extracted. The number of wins by each team was plotted in the form of bar chart. It was observed that India has won more matches than Australia.

The results of each test in a series were also analyzed. It was seen that Australia mostly took lead at the first match but India was ready with a comeback.

The performance of the best bowlers, highest scorers, Man of the Match and Man of the Series was also analyzed. It was interesting to see that the top 4 out of 5 best bowlers were spinners and among the 4 spinners 3 were Indians. Sachin Tendulkar Sir was at the top for the highest scorer and Man of the Series.

The performance of the teams under different captaincy was also analyzed. It was found that India won most of their matches under MS Dhoni's captaincy and Australia won most of their matches under Michael Clarke and Steve Waugh captaincy.
